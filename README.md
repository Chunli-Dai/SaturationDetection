# SaturationDetection

Here is an algorithm for the local detection of saturation striping by a wavelet transform, used to detect periodic variations of brightness (i.e. striping) with varying frequencies at different locations, combined with the use of unidirectional brightness gradients. The algorithm is applicable to raw, orthorectified and resampled satellite imagery.

TestSatuFilter.m: a test main program.
SatuFilter.m: the kernel code for saturation detection.
